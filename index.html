                                There is a reason that most web developers gleefully implement
                            frameworks into their web applications, even when those frameworks
                            aren't completely transparent. Essentially, doing everything manually 
                            comes with the added cost of having to handle browser specific, tool specific,
                            and site specific compatbility issues. What then, is one to do if the
                            goal is to demonstrate competency in the basics; avoiding frameworks
                            because they remove the learning experience of problem solving.

                        <p class="photoBlurb">Case in point. What you see isn't what you get. The CSS works beautifully
                            in Chrome's emulator (left) but iOS (simulated here but also on the real phone) has different
                            ideas.

                            Chrome's built in developer tools are really something to be celebrated.
                        They're free, they work pretty well, and they can provide a trove of useful information
                        on-the-fly to help you iron out whatever issues you may be facing (there are always plenty). However,
                        when building this very site, one of the massive downsides of relying ONLY on Chrome
                        developer tools is that it fails to simulate iOS devices properly.
                        </p>

                        <p class="postContent">
                            There have been a number of key times during the construction of this tiny
                        application, where my CSS skills could produce the desired outcome in the Chrome
                        simulator, but not when the site was loaded on a real iOS device via Github pages.
                        So what is a budding web developer to do? Well, if you're on a Mac rejoice! This instance
                        is one of the few places where Apple's tight integration solves a problem you didn't even
                        know you had! By running the device simulator tool in Xcode, and pasting a live server address
                        into the safari app on the simulator, you can have true iOS emulation on a real webkit safari
                        right next to you IDE of choice. And if that IDE happens to be VSCode, there is a live server
                        extension that you can add to it (it's literally called "live server").
                        </p>

                        <p class="postContent">
                            If you're on a PC, things become slightly more complicated. You'll have to rely on the Chrome
                        emulator to get 90% of the way there. Once reached, either a physical device in combination with a
                        hosted page (Github pages really does help here, especially if you use Github anyways) or emulating MacOS
                        is the best way I currently know of to have similar functionality. Of course, it could be argued that Apple's
                        approach to web is what causes the problem in the first place, but like it or not, the reality is that websites
                        need to work well on all devices including iPhones. In the future of course, I will utilize more frameworks to
                        avoid such unneccesary complexity and focus more on building the best site I can build, instead of re-solving
                        issues that have already been addressed.
