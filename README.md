<!-- CHANGELOG -->
## Changelog:

11.3.20:
- Set up the repository and the core framework for the site.

### Main Branch:

11.3.20:
- [001-0.0.1]: Added the core layout of the site and followed an excellent guide by othneildrew on Github to better organize my Readme.
- [002-0.0.1]: Readme Formatting >> Tweaked the formatting for the readme, since the markdown didn't work quite as expected on the first try.
- [003-0.0.2]: Layout + Prestyle >> Configured the global CSS grid (trying a different approach this time) and added the basic styling elements for the mobile version."
- [004-0.0.2]: Fixing Mobile Grid >> Trying to seperate the global grid out into areas that make sense for the overall flow for the website.
- [005-0.0.3]: Fixed intro area for mobile >> Used a sub-grid for the intro so that it has its own unique styling irrespective of the global-grid. Added a fourth CSS page for the smaller styling changes for the website."
- [006-0.0.4]: Added test photo + styling >> Added a larger test photo to the site so that the styling automatically handles larger photos on the mobile version. Also got the general styling to line up properly.
- [007-0.0.4]: Added click/tap toggle >> For the mobile version of the site it makes sense for the user to tap on the individual sections and then scroll through the information there which is too long to display fully on the site normally."
- [008-0.0.4]: Added overscroll behavior >> Still need to try and get the elements to positon in the full size of the viewport; currently the area where the parent is affects how the expanded version displays."
- [009-0.0.5]: Fixed position >> Set the position attribute to fixed (documentation puns lol) to solve the content displaying relative to parent container instead of relative to the viewport.
- [010-0.0.5]: Modal section >> Added a section for modals since the specific effect that I was oroginally aiming for does not play well with CSS grid. WIll work on adding the modals for each section as well as the touch layer.

11.4.20:
- [011-0.0.5]: Was still having trouble implementing the modals in the way that I wanted to. All of the methods seem to cause issues with CSS grid either re-aligning or otherwise messing up the order of the 'cards'. Will attempt another approach next time, as there are other things I have to address today.

11.5.20:
- [012-0.0.5]: Modals >> Implemented the necessary core functionality for modals to display in the mobile version. Also added new feature issues and a milestone for the project to better practice dev ops procedures assuming that in the future I will have to collaborate with other developers."
