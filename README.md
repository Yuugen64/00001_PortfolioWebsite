### Main Branch:

11.3.20:
- [001-0.0.1]: Added the core layout of the site and followed an excellent guide by othneildrew on Github to better organize my Readme.
- [002-0.0.1]: Readme Formatting >> Tweaked the formatting for the readme, since the markdown didn't work quite as expected on the first try.
- [003-0.0.2]: Layout + Prestyle >> Configured the global CSS grid (trying a different approach this time) and added the basic styling elements for the mobile version."
- [004-0.0.2]: Fixing Mobile Grid >> Trying to seperate the global grid out into areas that make sense for the overall flow for the website.
- [005-0.0.3]: Fixed intro area for mobile >> Used a sub-grid for the intro so that it has its own unique styling irrespective of the global-grid. Added a fourth CSS page for the smaller styling changes for the website."
